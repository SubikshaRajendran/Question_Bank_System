## Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended)
-   **MongoDB** running locally on port `27017`

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies (Root Directory)

Open a terminal in the project root (`c:\Users\sweth\OneDrive\Desktop\QB 4`) and run:
```bash
npm install

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies (Client Directory)

Open another terminal (or change directory) to `client` and run:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend

Make sure MongoDB is running.
In the project root, run:
```bash
npm run dev
# OR
npm start
```
The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Start the Frontend

In the `client` directory, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The frontend will start (usually on `http://localhost:5173`).

## Accessing the Application

Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the frontend terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
